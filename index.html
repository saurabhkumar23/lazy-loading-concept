        <h1>What Is Lazy Loading?</h1>
        <h2>Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of 
            resources until they're actually needed to improve 
            performance and save system resources. Lazy loading 
            images means loading images on websites 
            only when they appear in the browser’s viewport. This 
            means that if users don’t scroll all the way 
            down, images placed at the bottom of the page won’t even be loaded.
            All the media-heavy sites use this approach like unsplash.com, pexels.com and the 
            social media websites too.

                lazy: works great for lazy loading
                eager: instructs the browser to load the specified content right away
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>The loading attribute gives us the option to 
            delay off-screen images and iframes until 
            users scroll to their location on the page.
