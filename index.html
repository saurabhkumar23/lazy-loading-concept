        <h1>What Is Lazy Loading?</h1>
        <h2>Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of 
            resources until they're actually needed to improve 
            performance and save system resources. Lazy loading 
            images means loading images on websites 
            only when they appear in the browser’s viewport. This 
            means that if users don’t scroll all the way 
            down, images placed at the bottom of the page won’t even be loaded.
            All the media-heavy sites use this approach like unsplash.com, pexels.com and the 
            social media websites too.

        <h2>Techniques for implementing lazy loading:</h2>
        <h2>#1 Native Lazy Loading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Only applies to images and iframes</li>
            
            <li>just use the loading attribute with values (lazy or eager) to image and iframe tag.
                The loading attribute gives us the option to 
            delay off-screen images and iframes until 
            users scroll to their location on the page.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>lazy: works great for lazy loading</li>
                <li>eager: instructs the browser to load the specified content right away</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>#2 Lazy Loading Using the Intersection Observer API</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously 
            observe changes in the intersection of a target 
            element with an ancestor element or with a top-level 
            document’s viewport.
            </li>
            <li>
                for images, the path is contained inside a data-src attribute, not a src attribute. 
                The reason is that using src means the image would load right away, 
                which is not what you want
            </li>
        </ul>
